= History & raison d'Ãªtre =

On may 2013 DeMomentSomTres was asked to build a web for [a small restaurant in Argentona (Barcelona) called La Fonda del Casal](http://www.lafondadelcasal.cat "An example of web using the DeMomentSomTres Restaurant WordPress Plugin").

Our experience building websites for small restaurants showed us the need to have a plugin to make them easy to manage their menus and meals lists. They needed an easy way to publish that but we needed it not inside the blog. A custom type was required. 
They also needed a way to show the day menu in the frontpage without rewriting it. The shortcode was born. And this shortcode allowed us to put all the menus of diferent types together in a single page but that can be managed as many: wines, salads, meals... [Test it at Fonda del Casal Restaurant](http://www.lafondadelcasal.cat/plats "Live test menu").

== Installation ==

It can be installed as any other WordPress plugin. It doesn't have any special requirements.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I show the last menu of a certain type inside a post or page =

You can use the shortcode `[demomentsomtres-restaurant-dish-list type=id count=N hidden_titles title_format="h3"]` to show the N current dish lists of type id inside the post or page. 

* Type id is required. 
* Count is assumed to be 1 if not present. 
* If you want to hide the titles the parameter hidden_titles must be present.
* You can define the HTML tag for titles using title_format. If no value provided it is assumed to be h3.

= Why there's no widget to show the menus lists =

The plugin [Recent Posts Widget Extended](http://wordpress.org/plugins/recent-posts-widget-extended/) is enough for our needs and is highly customizable. As we don't like to reinvent the wheel, we did not code any widget.

= Additional shortcodes =

There'are the following additional shortcodes with the following features:

* [ECO]: inserts an `<i class="icon-eco">Ecological</i>` element.
* [PROX]: inserts an `<i class="icon-prox">Proximity</i>` element.
* [P XXX]: inserts an `<div class="price">XXX</div>` element.

= How do I show all the public dish lists =

You can call the restaurant archive to show the contents on an archive basis.

= How to customize the message on expired dish lists =

To customize expiry message you can use css class `.demomentsomtres-restaurant-expired`.
